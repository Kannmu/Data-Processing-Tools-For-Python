# PyKMTools: A python tool base for kannmu

PyKMTools is a Python library that provides a convenient interface for using OpenViBE software. It aims to simplify the development process by offering a set of tools and utilities.

## Installation

To install PyKMTools, you can use pip:

```shell
pip install PyKMTools
```

## Example Usage

Here is an simple example that demonstrates how to use PyKMTools to train a PyTorch model:

```python
import PyKMTools as pk
import numpy as np
import torch.nn as nn
import torch

# Create sample model
class Model(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Model, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(2, 128)
        self.output = nn.Linear(128, 4)

    def forward(self, X):
        X = self.fc1(X)
        X = self.output(X)
        return X

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create an instance of the model
    model = Model()

    # Set training hyperparameters
    hyperparameters = pk.tnn.Hyperparameters(
        Total_Epoch=100,  # Total epochs to train
        Learning_Rate=0.0001,  # Learning rate
        Batch_Size=8,  # Batch size for training
        Validate_Per_N_Epoch=3,  # Perform validation after N epochs
        Dropout_Rate=0.5,  # Dropout rate
        Train_Rate=0.9,  # Train data rate
        Weight_Decay=0.01,  # Weight decay for optimizer
        N_Targets=4,  # Number of targets for the model
        RunSavePath="./Runs/Test/",  # The path where the trained model will be saved
        DataProcessingPath="./UsageDemo.py"  # The path of the data processing script
    )

    # Create a training process
    train_process = pk.tnn.TrainProcess(
        Hyperparameters=hyperparameters,
        Model=model,
        Optimizer="AdamW",
        LossFunc="CrossEntropy"
    )

    # Generate input data
    X = [[i, 2 * i] for i in np.arange(0, 100, 0.1)]
    Y = [int((j[0] + j[1]) % 4) for j in X]

    # Load the data into the training process
    train_process.LoadData(X, Y)

    # Start the training process
    train_process.StartTrain()

```
